After logging in to the jenkins we need add 
1. credentialsId: 'dockerhub-credentials',
   usernameVariable: 'DOCKERHUB_USERNAME',
   passwordVariable: 'DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD'

2. we need to run (ssh-keygen) and paste the private key into the github sshkey section.

3. we need to add the docker to knownhost section of the instace (get the info from the chatGPT).

4. install the requied plugin (git, stageview, docker, pipeline etc).
